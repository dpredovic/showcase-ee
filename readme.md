# EE Showcase #

This project should show some of the "state of the art" EE capabilities, including:

* CDI instead of Spring
* remoting via JAX-WS, JAX-RS and JBoss EJB
* integration with JBoss 7
* integration tests via Arquillian
* proxy based repository (DAO) implementation via spring-data-jpa
* declarative caching using Infinispan CDI integration
* async method execution using EJB 3.1
